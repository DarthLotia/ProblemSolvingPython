# Problem Solving Python
Why should I tackle problems with Python? Other programming languages, such as MATLAB, LabView, C++, and Java, are available. What makes Python so useful for problem-solving? In one way, Python is easy to learn and use, thus problem solvers can code answers faster in Python than they can in other programming languages. Python programmes are typically shorter and faster to write than programmes written in other languages that do the same job. It's solutions may be produced and tested quickly in the rapid design, prototype, test, iterate cycle. Python's syntax is also quite readable by humans. While programmers can become fascinated with the runtime of a software.
